  <h1>Three.JS: Source 24.53 Beta</h1>
  <p>Internal Aperture Science Experimental Report</p>
</header>

<main>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>Experimental, beta, highly volatile. Authorized personnel only.</p>

<h2>Responsible Personnel</h2>
<div class="personnel">
  <h3>Emily Johnson - Co-CEO</h3>
  <p>Age 21, emotionally sensitive, frequently in trouble, has been with the cops due to bad choices and doesn’t care about them. Often shouts <span class="quote">"God Damn it Jerry!"</span> when experiments go awry. Responsible for ethics and documentation, though often overwhelmed by chaos.</p>
</div>
<div class="personnel">
  <h3>Cave Johnson - CEO & Founder</h3>
  <p>Reckless visionary, inventor of numerous Aperture devices. Constantly pushes experimental boundaries, often dragging Emily Johnson into chaos for “scientific insight.”</p>
</div>
<div class="personnel">
  <h3>Jerry Johnson - Former Director</h3>
  <p>Exasperatingly competent, primary instigator of Emily’s outbursts, occasionally tries to mediate experiments but usually causes more trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="personnel">
  <h3>Caroline Johnson - Backbone of Aperture Science</h3>
  <p>Steadfast and unflappable, maintains operational integrity and prevents catastrophic system failure. Often the only calming influence during portal emergencies.</p>
</div>

<h2>Key Features & Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Render and interact with cubes, spheres, buttons, and portals in full Aperture-grade physics.</li>
  <li>Simulate experimental test chambers with potential hazards and AI unpredictability.</li>
  <li>Monitor portal-induced anomalies and environmental instabilities.</li>
  <li>Experience executive oversight and emotional stress testing of sensitive personnel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Risks & Warnings</h2>
<ul>
  <li class="warning">Emotional Hazard:</li>
  <p>Expect frequent shouting of <span class="quote">"God Damn it Jerry!"</span> from Emily Johnson during misaligned AI, test chamber collapse, or portal misuse.</p>
  <li class="warning">Structural Instability:</li>
  <p>Test chambers may suffer from minor to severe portal-induced spatial distortion.</p>
  <li class="warning">Cube & Sphere Hazard:</li>
  <p>Weighted Companion Cubes, Spheres, and other devices may misbehave, causing impact events.</p>
  <li class="warning">AI Misbehavior:</li>
  <p>Simulated AI may act unpredictably, occasionally requiring intervention by Caroline Johnson or further distress to Emily Johnson.</p>
  <li class="warning">Cave Johnson Experiments:</li>
  <p>Expect reckless actions, sudden explosions, and inventive “progress.” Emily Johnson is often caught in the middle.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Operational Protocols</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Preserve this license and attribution to the executive team.</li>
  <li>Include warnings for emotional stress, AI unpredictability, and portal chaos when modifying or extending the project.</li>
  <li>Unauthorized commercial use, cloning, AI replication, or interdimensional testing is prohibited.</li>
  <li>Participation in Aperture Science beta testing is mandatory. Cake is optional. Emotional distress is inevitable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By using this repository, you acknowledge that Emily Johnson will continue to be <span class="quote">in trouble</span>, shouting <span class="quote">"God Damn it Jerry!"</span> at high frequency. Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson, and Caroline Johnson will continue to enact unpredictable, chaotic, and occasionally dangerous experimental procedures. You, as a participant, are now part of the official Aperture Science internal beta testing program.</p>
<p class="warning">Final Reminder: Press cubes, activate portals, survive AI mischief, embrace chaos, testing is mandatory, cake is not guaranteed, and Emily Johnson’s rebellious antics are unavoidable.</p>
