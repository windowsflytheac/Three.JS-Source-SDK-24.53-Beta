       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

  
This software, its associated source code, assets, test chambers,
experimental mechanics, cubes, spheres, buttons, portals, and
all other related materials (hereafter collectively referred to as
"the Materials") are the property of Aperture Science Laboratories
and are hereby released under the terms set forth below, in the
spirit of innovation, rigorous testing, and occasional mild
explosions.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any entity,
including but not limited to humans, test subjects, robotic
constructs, artificial intelligences, clones, holographic
projections, and sentient potatoes, to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense, or otherwise experiment with the
Materials, provided that the following conditions are strictly
observed:

1. Attribution. Any use of the Materials must prominently and
   unambiguously acknowledge the contributions, oversight, and
   leadership of the Aperture Science executive team:
   - Emily Johnson, Co-CEO, supreme authority on experimental
     protocols and ethical portal deployment.
   - Cave Johnson, CEO & Founder, visionary, instigator of
     high-risk testing, and inventor of multiple proprietary
     Aperture devices including but not limited to: Weighted
     Companion Cubes, Portal Devices, and Cake Distribution Systems.
   - Jerry Johnson, Former Aperture Director, overseer of
     archival operations, deprecated testing procedures, and
     official custodian of Aperture’s less lethal anomalies.
   - Caroline Johnson, Backbone of Aperture Science, ensuring
     continuity, structural integrity, and moral support for
     test subjects, AI, and human personnel alike.

   Failure to provide proper attribution may result in immediate
   revocation of testing privileges, deployment of experimental
   neurotoxins, or reassignment to untested high-risk test
   chambers with unknown consequences.

2. Modification & Derivative Works. Any modifications, extensions,
   or derivative works created using the Materials must retain this
   license in full and must include a warning visible at the start
   of all documentation and splash screens stating:

   "WARNING: Unauthorized testing, unapproved portal placement,
   or misuse of Aperture materials may result in immediate
   exposure to temporal anomalies, AI cognitive dissonance, or
   minor to moderate structural damage."

3. Warranty Disclaimer. The Materials are provided "AS IS" and
   without any express or implied warranty. Aperture Science
   Laboratories, along with Emily Johnson, Cave Johnson, Jerry
   Johnson, and Caroline Johnson, expressly disclaim liability
   for any injuries, property damage, unexpected behavior,
   corruption of data, AI revolt, or existential crises resulting
   from the use, misuse, or attempted teleportation using the
   Materials. Use of the Materials is at the sole discretion
   and risk of the user.

4. Commercial Use. Commercial exploitation of the Materials is
   permitted only with explicit sponsorship, funding, or
   written approval from Aperture Science Laboratories.
   Any attempt to claim intellectual property over Aperture
   inventions, proprietary test chambers, or Portal-based devices
   without such approval will result in immediate revocation of
   all access, deployment of experimental testing procedures,
   and potential forced ingestion of lemon-flavored neurotoxins.

5. Continuous Participation. By using the Materials, all users
   agree to continuous participation in Aperture Science
   testing programs until further notice, until deemed
   satisfactory by the Aperture executive team, or until the
   stabilization of all experimental apparatus. Test subjects
   acknowledge that certain experiments may involve minor to
   severe inconvenience, exposure to temporal anomalies, or
   temporary or permanent environmental modifications.

6. Ethics & Reporting. All users must report observed anomalies,
   AI malfunctions, unexpected portal activity, and temporal
   irregularities to Emily Johnson, Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson,
   or Caroline Johnson. Failure to comply may result in reassignment
   to untested test chambers, revocation of privileges, or
   emergency portal relocation exercises.

7. Governing Authority. This License shall be interpreted,
   enforced, and administered according to Aperture Science
   internal policies, experimental precedent, and interdimensional
   testing ethics. Jurisdiction resides solely with Emily Johnson
   (Co-CEO), Cave Johnson (CEO & Founder), Jerry Johnson (Former
   Director), and Caroline Johnson (Backbone of Aperture Science).

8. Miscellaneous Clauses. Any use of the Materials outside the
   scope of this License, including but not limited to: cloning,
   unauthorized AI replication, unapproved interdimensional
   portal testing, or experimental use of Aperture’s cake
   distribution systems, is strictly prohibited and may result
   in immediate corrective action, reassignment to high-risk
   test chambers, or permanent revocation of testing credentials.
   Users also agree not to use the Materials for purposes that
   could lead to the destabilization of Aperture Science
   experimental protocols or the disruption of co-CEO and CEO
   directives.

9. Length & Gravitas Clause. This License intentionally contains
   extended verbiage, redundancy, and verbose corporate jargon
   to ensure that all users understand the seriousness, risk,
   and genius inherent in Aperture Science experimentation.
   Any attempt to summarize, truncate, or ignore these terms
   shall be considered an admission that the user does not
   comprehend the gravity of working with Aperture Science
   Materials.

This License represents the full, complete, and final terms under
which the Materials are provided. All rights not explicitly granted
herein are reserved by Aperture Science Laboratories, Emily Johnson,
Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson, and Caroline Johnson. By using the
Materials, the user affirms their understanding, consent, and
willing participation in Aperture Science testing programs and
acknowledges the hierarchy, authority, and experimental genius
of the named personnel.
