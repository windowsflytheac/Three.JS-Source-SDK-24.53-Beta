# Three.JS-Source-SDK-24.53-Beta

Welcome to Three.JS: Source 24.53 Beta, the ultimate experimental sandbox of Aperture Science. This software allows authorized personnel to simulate, manipulate, and test cubes, spheres, buttons, portals, and other high-risk experimental devices entirely in WebGL. Here’s what you need to know:

Key Features & Objectives:

Render fully interactive cubes, spheres, buttons, and portals with Aperture-grade physics fidelity.

Simulate experimental test chambers, including potential structural hazards and unpredictable AI behavior.

Monitor portal-induced spatial anomalies, environmental instabilities, and unintended chaos.

Experience full executive oversight, including emotional stress testing of sensitive personnel (i.e., Emily Johnson).

Personnel Behavior Report:

Emily Johnson (Co-CEO, age 21): Frequently in trouble for shouting "God Damn it Jerry!" at every minor procedural infraction, AI misalignment, or unapproved portal placement. Has a rebellious streak — has been with the cops due to bad choices and could not care less about authority. Responsible for testing ethics, documentation, and occasionally exploding in frustration.

Cave Johnson (CEO & Founder): Continuously pushes experimental boundaries, often ignoring warnings and safety protocols. Induces emergencies for “scientific insight,” frequently dragging Emily Johnson into chaos.

Jerry Johnson (Former Director): Expert at subtle chaos. Primary instigator of Emily Johnson’s exclamations. Occasionally attempts to mediate experiments, usually making things worse.

Caroline Johnson (Backbone of Aperture Science): Maintains operational integrity, moral support, and keeps the labs from total collapse. Often the only calming influence amid portal-related emergencies and Co-CEO stress.

Known Risks & Warnings:

Emotional Hazard: Expect frequent shouting of "God Damn it Jerry!" from Emily Johnson, particularly during AI misbehavior, test chamber collapse, or unauthorized portal deployment.

Structural Instability: Test chambers may experience minor to severe portal-induced spatial distortion.

Cube & Sphere Hazard: Weighted Companion Cubes, Spheres, and other experimental devices may misbehave, causing minor to catastrophic impact events.

AI Misbehavior: Simulated AI may act unpredictably, requiring immediate intervention by Caroline Johnson or resulting in further distress to Emily Johnson.

Cave Johnson Experiments: Reckless, explosive, and inventive. Emily Johnson is often caught in the middle.

Operational Protocols:

Preserve this license and attribution to the executive team.

Include warnings for emotional stress, AI unpredictability, portal chaos, and rebellious personnel when modifying or extending the project.

Unauthorized commercial use, cloning, AI replication, or interdimensional testing is prohibited.

Participation in Aperture Science beta testing is mandatory. Cake is optional. Emotional distress is inevitable.

Conclusion:

By using this repository, you acknowledge that:

You are entering a hazardous, experimental environment.

Emily Johnson will continue to be in trouble, shouting "God Damn it Jerry!" and disregarding authority due to her past bad choices and rebellious streak.

Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson, and Caroline Johnson will continue to enact unpredictable, chaotic, and occasionally dangerous experimental procedures.

You, as a participant, are now part of the official Aperture Science internal beta testing program.

Final Reminder: Press cubes, activate portals, survive AI mischief, embrace the chaos, and remember that testing is mandatory, cake is not guaranteed, and Emily Johnson’s rebellious antics are an unavoidable part of Aperture Science life.
