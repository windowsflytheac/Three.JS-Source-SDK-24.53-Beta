       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

  
This software, its source code, assets, test chambers, portals,
experimental mechanics, cubes, spheres, buttons, and all
related materials (hereafter collectively referred to as "the
Materials") are the property of Aperture Science Laboratories and
are provided under the terms described herein. These terms have
been meticulously crafted, reviewed, and reluctantly approved
by the Aperture executive team:

- Emily Johnson, Co-CEO, age 21, highly sensitive, chief
  coordinator of experimental ethics, and prone to shouting
  "God Damnit Jerry" at the slightest procedural misalignment.
- Cave Johnson, CEO & Founder, visionary, inventor of Aperture
  experimental devices, and authority on high-risk testing.
- Jerry Johnson, Former Aperture Director, overseer of archival
  operations, custodian of deprecated testing protocols, and
  habitual source of Emily Johnsonâ€™s exclamations.
- Caroline Johnson, Backbone of Aperture Science, ensuring
  structural integrity, moral support, and uninterrupted
  operational continuity across all experimental programs.

PERMISSIONS

1. **Commercial Use:** Allowed only with explicit sponsorship,
   written approval, or funding from the Aperture executive team.
   Unauthorized commercial exploitation may trigger immediate
   reassignment to high-risk test chambers or exposure to
   unexpected environmental effects.

2. **Modification:** Modifications, derivative works, or new
   test chambers are permitted provided that:
   - This License remains intact in full.
   - All attributions to Emily Johnson, Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson,
     and Caroline Johnson are preserved.
   - Clear warnings regarding experimental hazards, portal
     anomalies, AI unpredictability, and emotional sensitivity
     of Co-CEO are included.

3. **Distribution:** Permitted for internal testing, educational
   purposes, research, or recreational cube pressing, provided
   the license and attributions are retained.

4. **Patent Use:** Granted for Aperture-invented devices and
   protocols, exclusively for experimental purposes. Unauthorized
   commercial application is prohibited.

5. **Private Use:** Fully permitted, including safe pressing
   of cubes, buttons, portals, or minor frustration-inducing
   events.

LIMITATIONS

1. **Trademark Use:** Use of Aperture Science names, logos,
   cake references, or executive quotes for commercial purposes
   without express approval is strictly prohibited.

2. **Liability:** Materials are provided "AS IS". Aperture Science
   Laboratories, Emily Johnson, Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson, and
   Caroline Johnson disclaim all liability for injuries, broken
   test chambers, AI revolt, temporal anomalies, emotional
   distress to sensitive personnel, or the uttering of expletives
   such as "God Damnit Jerry."

3. **Warranty:** No express or implied warranty is provided.
   Users assume all risk, including portal instability, cube
   crushing hazards, AI misbehavior, structural collapse,
   and emotional turmoil for sensitive co-CEOs.

CONDITIONS

1. **License and Copyright Notice:** All copies, modifications,
   derivative works, or distributions must retain this license
   and include clear attribution to Emily Johnson (Co-CEO),
   Cave Johnson (CEO & Founder), Jerry Johnson (Former Director),
   and Caroline Johnson (Backbone of Aperture Science).

2. **State Changes:** All modifications, extensions, or new
   test chambers must include warnings regarding portal anomalies,
   cube hazards, AI unpredictability, and sensitivity-induced
   exclamations from the Co-CEO.

3. **Continuous Participation:** Users agree to participate in
   Aperture Science testing programs indefinitely or until
   authorized personnel determine testing may safely conclude.
   Participation may involve minor to severe inconvenience,
   temporary environmental alterations, or emotional outbursts
   such as "God Damnit Jerry."

4. **Ethics & Reporting:** Users must report anomalies, AI
   malfunctions, unexpected portal interactions, or hazardous
   conditions to Emily Johnson, Cave Johnson, Jerry Johnson, or
   Caroline Johnson. Failure to comply may result in reassignment
   to untested high-risk test chambers or other corrective measures.

5. **Governing Authority:** This License is governed by Aperture
   Science internal policy, experimental precedent, and
   interdimensional testing ethics. Jurisdiction resides solely
   with Emily Johnson (Co-CEO), Cave Johnson (CEO & Founder),
   Jerry Johnson (Former Director), and Caroline Johnson (Backbone).

6. **Miscellaneous Clauses:** Any use outside the scope of this
   License, including but not limited to cloning, unauthorized
   AI replication, interdimensional portal testing, misuse of
   cake distribution systems, or causing emotional distress to
   the Co-CEO, is strictly prohibited and may result in
   immediate corrective action, reassignment, or revocation
   of testing privileges.

7. **Absurdity Clause:** This License intentionally contains
   extended verbiage, repetition, corporate jargon, and humor
   to emphasize the genius, risk, and occasional absurdity of
   Aperture Science experiments. Any attempt to ignore or
   summarize these terms shall be treated as a severe
   misjudgment of experimental protocol.
